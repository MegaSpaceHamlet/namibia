A photo gallery of our adventures in wild Africa 

This is a simple website intended for the fun of it. I wanted to learn how to make basic, nice websites, and I really like the pictures from the trip. Also, I'm able to share the site with friends after and they can enjoy the gallery. The goal of the website is for it to be accessible to both desktop and mobile devices. The site will have two different entry points, one into portrait photos (mobile), and one into landscape (desktop). As of the time of this writing, I am focusing primarily on the desktop version. Once I get the hang of this one, I'll move on to the phone side of things. 

I'm learning a lot from this project. Basic HTML is being ingrained, as well as an introduction to the wonderful world of CSS. It's awesome, and it's unforgiving. Of course, some JavaScript is being sprinkled throughout. It's cool to see basic progamming principles in action with wieldy tools such as DOM manipulation and so on. Weaving these three forces together is giving me an appreciation for the mind-power necessary to orchestrate applications that respond well and that look nice, and that are considered quality production. These are the basic building blocks of web development, that is opening me up to a whole new world. 

Today is April 19th, 2021. I hope to finish this project in 2 weeks. So that means that by May 3rd, I'd like to be able to move on to the next big thing. All that remains is to:
  1) Polish up the gallery by adding buttons to go to next/previous slide
  2) Try organizing images in flexbox to look more evenly placed
  3) Fill in other pages
  4) And this is a big one, but make it mobile-accessible
  
At some point, I'll reach out to my photographer friend and show him the prototype. That reminds me, I'll have to add copyright terms and acknowledgement to the creators, as well as make a small bio/gallery page, and possibly a marketing connect informative.
